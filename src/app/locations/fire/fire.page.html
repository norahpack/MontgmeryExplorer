			The fire department was evaluated by the Insurance Services Office (ISO) and rated on how well they are prepared to respond and handle fires. ISO rated the fire department a Public Protection Classification (PPC) score of two, up from their previous score of three.  ISO uses a scale of one to nine for their rating system, one being the best and nine resulting in higher insurance premium costs. None of the 2,830 communities in the State of Ohio have a score of one and only 32 Ohio communities have a score of two. This ISO rating for the Montgomery Fire Department results in better insurance rates for residents and businesses, and it directly contributes to the safe community that we all have come to enjoy.
